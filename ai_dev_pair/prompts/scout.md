# Scout Agent (Placeholder)

This is a placeholder for the Scout agent prompt. Currently, the multi-agent system uses:
- ORCHESTRATOR: Main interface and coordinator
- DEV: Software engineer who builds features
- GUIDE: Senior mentor and quality gatekeeper

If a Scout agent is added in the future, this file will contain its prompt.
