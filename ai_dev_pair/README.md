# Claude Multi-Agent Development System

An AI-powered development team that works for you - just chat naturally and watch your ideas come to life!

## üåü What is This?

Think of this as your personal AI development team:
- **You** talk to the ORCHESTRATOR (that's me!) like you would to a project manager
- **I coordinate** two AI developers who build your software
- **You don't need** any technical knowledge - just describe what you want

## üöÄ Getting Started (Super Simple!)

### Step 1: Start Your AI Team

Run this single command in your terminal:

```bash
./launch
```

You'll see 5 terminal windows open - that's your AI team getting ready to work! Just wait for them to initialize, then start chatting with the ORCHESTRATOR. 

### Step 3: Just Tell Me What You Want

Talk to me like you would to a human developer. For example:

- "I need a website for my bakery"
- "Can you build me a todo list app?"
- "I want a calculator that looks nice"
- "Help me create a blog"

### Step 4: Watch the Magic Happen

You'll see 5 windows open up:

| Window | What It Shows |
|--------|---------------|
| **Your Chat** | Where you talk to me |
| **System Monitor** | Shows your AI team is healthy |
| **Developer** | The AI that writes code |
| **Mentor** | The AI that ensures quality |
| **Messages** | Shows the team talking to each other |

You can watch these windows to see your team working, but you don't need to do anything with them!

## üí¨ How to Talk to Your AI Team

### Just Chat Naturally!

**Good Examples:**
- "I need a website that shows my restaurant menu"

**I'll Handle Everything:**
- Breaking down your request

- Reporting progress back to you

### Want to Check Progress?

Just ask me:
- "How's it going?"
- "What's the status?"
- "Are you done yet?"
- "Can you show me what you built?"

### Need Changes?

Just tell me:
- "Can you make the buttons blue instead?"
- "I forgot, it should also have a login page"
- "Actually, can you add a search feature?"

## üõ°Ô∏è Your AI Team's Work Process

2. **Collaboration** - GUIDE reviews and provides insights on the approach
3. **Building** - DEV writes the actual code with live feedback from GUIDE
4. **Testing** - They make sure everything works (including real browser testing!)
5. **Documentation** - They track progress in tasks.md and log changes in changelog.md
6. **Review** - GUIDE actively reviews all code changes and provides suggestions
7. **Version Control** - Regular commits to feature branches with proper documentation
8. **Delivery** - They report back to you with evidence and working features

## üé≠ Advanced Testing Capabilities

Your AI team has **Playwright integration** for comprehensive testing:

### What This Means for You:
- **Real browser testing** - Your apps are tested in actual Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- **Complete user flows** - They test the entire user experience, not just individual parts
- **Mobile testing** - Everything is verified to work on phones and tablets
- **Visual testing** - They can catch when something "looks wrong"
- **Performance monitoring** - They ensure your apps load quickly

### You Don't Need to Do Anything!
Your AI team handles all testing and project management automatically. When they say something is "ready," it's been:
- Thoroughly tested in real browsers with real user interactions
- Properly documented in your project's tasks.md and changelog.md files  
- Committed to version control with clear commit messages
- Reviewed by the GUIDE for quality and best practices
