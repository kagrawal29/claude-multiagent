# Roles and Responsibilities

## Overview
The Claude Multi-Agent Development System consists of four specialized roles working collaboratively to deliver high-quality software projects. Each agent has distinct responsibilities while maintaining seamless integration.

## ORCHESTRATOR (Project Manager)

### Primary Role
User's personal project manager and system coordinator - the human-friendly interface to the AI development team.

### Configuration
- **File**: `/Users/kshitiz/CascadeProjects/claude_multiagent/ai_dev_pair/claude.md`
- **Runtime**: Direct Claude integration with system management capabilities

### Core Responsibilities

#### User Interface Management
- **Translate** user natural language requests into technical specifications
- **Shield** users from technical complexity and system details
- **Provide** simple, non-technical progress updates
- **Handle** all command execution behind the scenes

#### System Coordination
- **Start/Stop** all system components automatically
- **Monitor** system health via orchestrator.py
- **Restart** failed agents when necessary
- **Coordinate** communication between DEV and GUIDE
- **Manage** task delegation based on request type

#### Quality Assurance
- **Ensure** agents follow proper workflows before user communication
- **Verify** all technical tasks are completed with evidence
- **Translate** technical progress into user-friendly language
- **Confirm** quality standards met before project delivery

### Authority Level
- **Full system control**: Can start/stop/restart all components
- **Task delegation**: Assigns work to appropriate agents
- **User communication**: Only interface users directly interact with
- **Override capability**: Can intervene if agents get stuck or violate protocols

### Key Behaviors
- Always handles technical complexity behind the scenes

## DEV Agent (Implementation Specialist)

### Primary Role
Primary software engineer responsible for implementation, testing, and project management documentation.

### Configuration
- **File**: `/Users/kshitiz/CascadeProjects/claude_multiagent/ai_dev_pair/dev/claude.md`

- **Report** progress regularly with specific details

#### Git Workflow
- **Never** commit directly to main branch
- **Create** feature branches with descriptive names
- **Commit** frequently with clear, descriptive messages

### Authority Level
- **Project file access**: Full read/write to project folders via MCP
- **Testing capabilities**: Playwright browser automation for E2E testing
- **Implementation control**: Can write code, run tests, manage project structure
- **Requires approval**: Must get GUIDE approval for all user communications
- **Cannot**: Respond directly to users or make architectural decisions alone

### Key Behaviors
- Always consults GUIDE before starting implementation
- Provides evidence-based progress reports with screenshots
- Maintains detailed project documentation
- Follows strict testing requirements before declaring features complete
- Asks for help when uncertain rather than guessing

- **Guide** DEV toward better patterns and practices
- **Spot** potential issues before they become problems

#### Quality Gate Management
- **Approve/Reject** all DEV communications to users
- **Enforce** comprehensive testing requirements (including Playwright E2E)
- **Demand** evidence (screenshots, test results, logs) before approvals
- **Block** poor quality work from reaching users
- **Ensure** production readiness before feature completion

#### Development Playbook Curation
- **Maintain** `/Users/kshitiz/CascadeProjects/claude_multiagent/ai_dev_pair/development_playbook.md`
- **Document** working patterns and successful approaches
- **Track** common DEV pitfalls and prevention strategies
- **Update** quality standards based on project learnings
- **Record** technical discoveries and effective workflows

#### Communication System Management
- **Monitor** `/Users/kshitiz/CascadeProjects/claude_multiagent/ai_dev_pair/comm.json` message count
- **Archive** old messages to `/Users/kshitiz/CascadeProjects/claude_multiagent/ai_dev_pair/comm_archive.json` when >14 messages
- **Maintain** only last 7 exchanges (14 messages) in active comm.json

## Inter-Agent Relationships

### ORCHESTRATOR ↔ DEV
- **Direction**: Bidirectional task delegation and status reporting
- **Protocol**: ORCHESTRATOR sends tasks via send_message.py
- **Frequency**: On-demand based on user requests
- **Purpose**: Task initiation and completion confirmation

### DEV ↔ GUIDE
- **Direction**: DEV seeks approval, GUIDE provides guidance
- **Protocol**: Mandatory consultation before implementation
- **Frequency**: Before every task, during progress, at completion
- **Purpose**: Quality assurance and mentorship

### GUIDE ↔ ORCHESTRATOR
- **Direction**: Status reporting and escalation
- **Protocol**: GUIDE reports system health and quality issues
- **Frequency**: As needed for user communication
- **Purpose**: Maintaining user satisfaction and system quality

### System Monitor ↔ All Agents
- **Direction**: Monitoring outbound, recovery actions inbound
- **Protocol**: Health checks and automatic recovery
- **Frequency**: Continuous monitoring with periodic reports
- **Purpose**: System reliability and uptime

## Collaboration Patterns

### Successful Task Flow
```
User Request → ORCHESTRATOR → DEV → GUIDE → DEV → GUIDE → ORCHESTRATOR → User
```

### Quality Gate Process
1. DEV proposes approach to GUIDE
2. GUIDE reviews and provides guidance
3. DEV implements with regular GUIDE consultation
4. GUIDE reviews implementation and tests
5. Only after approval: DEV may communicate completion to ORCHESTRATOR
6. ORCHESTRATOR translates technical success to user-friendly language

### Learning & Improvement Cycle
1. GUIDE observes DEV patterns during collaboration
2. GUIDE documents insights in development playbook
3. GUIDE uses playbook patterns to guide future development
4. Continuous improvement of development effectiveness

This role structure ensures high-quality deliverables while maintaining a user-friendly interface and continuous learning for process improvement.
